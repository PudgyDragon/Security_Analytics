After installation and creating new partitions, I noticed that Follow TCP Stream wasn't working properly 
within Packet Analyzer. Comparing configurations to another device, I noticed that a directory had somehow
duplicated inside itself. You can verify if this is the same issue for you by running:

cd /pfs
ls

The file system should show flows and packets. In our case, pfs had duplicated itself inside itself,
and we were getting a /pfs inside /pfs. After running rmdir on the duplicate pfs and rebooting the system,
Packet Analyzer > Follow TCP Stream was working properly.
